# Programming-Foundations-with-HTML-CSS-and-JS-by-Duke-University

This is a foundation course which has allowed me to familiarise myself with HTML,CSS and Javascript.
The structure of the code is not totally correct and might seem slipshod because it is entered into a custom environment which immediately shows the output of the code.
CodePen was used for HTML/CSS/JS
And dukelearntoprogram was used for Javascript problem-solving.
