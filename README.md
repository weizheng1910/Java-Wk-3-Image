# Programming-Foundations-with-HTML-CSS-and-JS-by-Duke-University

This is a foundational course on HTML,CSS and Javascript.
The structure of the code is different because it is entered into custom environments which provide immediate feedback of the code.
CodePen was used for HTML/CSS/JS,
and dukelearntoprogram was used for Javascript problem-solving.
