# Programming-Foundations-with-HTML-CSS-and-JS-by-Duke-University

This is a foundation course familiarised me with HTML,CSS and Javascript.
The structure of the code is slightly different because it is entered into a custom environment which immediately shows the output of the code.
CodePen was used for HTML/CSS/JS,
and dukelearntoprogram was used for Javascript problem-solving.
